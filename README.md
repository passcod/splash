# Splash

**[SPLAT!]** is a wonderful tool for RF analysis over terrain. Unfortunately,
it only works with a few terrain sources, supports no more than four emitters
in one analysis, and makes use of only a single core.

**Splash** is not a rewrite of SPLAT!. It is a different implementation of the
_idea_ of SPLAT!, but taking different routes and making different decisions.
